## File Management

### Output Directory

Each session creates an independent directory named by content slug:

```
cover-image/{topic-slug}/
├── source-{slug}.{ext}    # Source files (text, images, etc.)
├── prompts/
│   └── cover.md
└── cover.png
```

**Slug Generation**:
1. Extract main topic from content (2-4 words, kebab-case)
2. Example: "The Future of AI" → `future-of-ai`

### Conflict Resolution

If `cover-image/{topic-slug}/` already exists:
- Append timestamp: `{topic-slug}-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`
- Example: `ai-future` exists → `ai-future-20260118-143052`

### Source Files

Copy all sources with naming `source-{slug}.{ext}`:
- `source-article.md` (main text content)
- `source-logo.png` (image from conversation)

Multiple sources supported: text, images, files from conversation.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Content

1. **Save source content** (if not already a file):
   - If user provides a file path: use as-is
   - If user pastes content: save to `source.md` in target directory

2. **Extract key information**:
   - **Main topic**: What is the article about?
   - **Core message**: What's the key takeaway?
   - **Tone**: Serious, playful, inspiring, educational?
   - **Keywords**: Identify style-signaling words

3. **Language detection**:
   - Detect **source language** from content
   - Detect **user language** from conversation context
   - Note if source_language ≠ user_language (will ask in Step 3)

### Step 2: Determine Options

1. **Style selection**:
   - If `--style` specified, use that style
   - Otherwise, scan content for style signals and auto-select 3 candidates
   - Default to `elegant` if no clear signals

2. **Aspect ratio**:
   - If `--aspect` specified, use that ratio
   - Otherwise, prepare options: 2.35:1 (cinematic), 16:9 (widescreen), 1:1 (social)

### Step 3: Confirm Options

**Purpose**: Let user confirm all options in a single step before generation.

**IMPORTANT**: Present ALL options in a single confirmation step using AskUserQuestion. Do NOT interrupt workflow with multiple separate confirmations.

**Determine which questions to ask**:

| Question | When to Ask |
|----------|-------------|
| Style | Always (required) |
| Aspect ratio | Always (offer common options) |
| Language | Only if `source_language ≠ user_language` |

**Present options** (use AskUserQuestion with all applicable questions):

**Question 1 (Style)** - always:
- Style A (recommended): [style name] - [brief description]
- Style B: [style name] - [brief description]
- Style C: [style name] - [brief description]
- Custom: Provide custom style reference

**Question 2 (Aspect)** - always:
- 2.35:1 Cinematic (Recommended) - ultra-wide, dramatic
- 16:9 Widescreen - standard video/presentation
- 1:1 Square - social media optimized

**Question 3 (Language)** - only if source ≠ user language:
- [Source language] (matches content)
- [User language] (your preference)

**Language handling**:
- If source language = user language: Just inform user (e.g., "Title will be in Chinese")
- If different: Ask which language to use for title text

### Step 4: Generate Cover Concept

Create a cover image concept based on selected style:

**Title** (if included, max 8 characters):
- Distill the core message into a punchy headline
- Use hooks: numbers, questions, contrasts, pain points
- Skip if `--no-title` flag is used

**Visual Elements**:
- Style-appropriate imagery and icons
- 1-2 symbolic elements representing the topic
- Metaphors or analogies that fit the style

### Step 5: Create Prompt File

Save prompt to `prompts/cover.md` with confirmed options.

**All prompts are written in the user's confirmed language preference.**

**Prompt Format**:

```markdown
Cover theme: [topic in 2-3 words]
Style: [selected style name]
Aspect ratio: [confirmed aspect ratio]

[If title included:]
Title text: [8 characters or less, in confirmed language]
Subtitle: [optional, in confirmed language]

Visual composition:
- Main visual: [description matching style]
- Layout: [positioning based on title inclusion and aspect ratio]
- Decorative elements: [style-appropriate elements]

Color scheme:
- Primary: [style primary color]
- Background: [style background color]
- Accent: [style accent color]

Style notes: [specific style characteristics to emphasize]

[If no title:]
Note: No title text, pure visual illustration only.
```

### Step 6: Generate Image

**Image Generation Skill Selection**:
1. Check available image generation skills
2. If multiple skills available, ask user to choose

**Generation**:
Call selected image generation skill with prompt file, output path, and confirmed aspect ratio.

### Step 7: Output Summary

```
Cover Image Generated!

Topic: [topic]
Style: [style name]
Aspect: [aspect ratio]
Title: [cover title] (or "No title - visual only")
Language: [confirmed language]
Location: [output path]

Preview the image to verify it matches your expectations.
```

## Notes

- Cover should be instantly understandable at small preview sizes
- Title (if included) must be readable and impactful
- Visual metaphors work better than literal representations
- Maintain style consistency throughout the cover
- Image generation typically takes 10-30 seconds
- Title text uses user's confirmed language preference
- Aspect ratio: 2.35:1 for cinematic/dramatic, 16:9 for widescreen, 1:1 for social media

## Extension Support

Custom styles and configurations via EXTEND.md.

**Check paths** (priority order):
1. `.content-gen-skills/cover-image/EXTEND.md` (project)
2. `~/.content-gen-skills/cover-image/EXTEND.md` (user)

If found, load before Step 1. Extension content overrides defaults.
